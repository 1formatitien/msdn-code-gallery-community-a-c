<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:small">Blackjack</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:small">, also known as twenty-one, is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. Blackjack is a comparing card
 game between a player and dealer, meaning that players compete against the dealer but not against any other players. It is played (in this version) with a deck of 52 cards. The object of the game is to beat the dealer, which can be done in a number of ways:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:small">Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a blackjack), without a dealer blackjack;</span>
</li><li><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:small">Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; or</span>
</li><li><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:small">Let the dealer draw additional cards until his or her hand exceeds 21.</span>
</li></ul>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:small">The player is dealt an initial two-card hand and adds together the value of their cards. Face cards (kings, queens, and jacks) are counted as ten points. A player and the dealer can count his or
 her own ace as 1 point or 11 points. All other cards are counted as the numeric value shown on the card. After receiving their initial two cards, players have the option of getting a &quot;hit&quot; (twisting), which is taking an additional card, or sticking. In a given
 round, the player or the dealer wins by having a score of 21 or by having the highest score that is less than 21. Scoring higher than 21 (called &quot;busting&quot; or &quot;going bust&quot;) results in a loss. A player may win by having any final score equal to or less than
 21 if the dealer busts.</span></p>

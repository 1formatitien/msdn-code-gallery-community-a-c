<p><span style="font-size:small">This is an updated version of an alarm clock i wrote as one of my first attempts at programming in vb2005
</span><span style="font-size:small">and my import for Microsoft.VisualBasic in the alarmSetter UserControl shows the level I was at at that time,
</span><span style="font-size:small">but I didn't change it to improve the code as it still works how I wanted it to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small">The application is a simple Alarm Clock, with a (menu) choice of a graphical analog clock or a digital clock.
</span><span style="font-size:small">The alarm time is set via a custom menuitem which hosts an instance of the alarmSetter UserControl via a
</span><span style="font-size:small">ToolStripControlHost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small">The clockworks for the analog and digital displays are accomplished through two timers and graphical methods,
</span><span style="font-size:small">with the digital clock being very simple, and the analog clock using some fairly advanced graphical functions and
</span><span style="font-size:small">methods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small">The alarm time and alarm status (on/off) are saved in My.Settings and the alarm is triggered at the selected time,
</span><span style="font-size:small">displaying a dialog and playing a *.wav file in a loop until the dialog is closed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:small">The analog clock option is a good example of some of the complex applications that can be created with GDI&#43;...</span></p>

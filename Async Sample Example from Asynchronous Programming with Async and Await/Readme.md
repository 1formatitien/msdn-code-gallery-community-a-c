## Description

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This sample is a WPF application that contains the example method from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh191443.aspx">
Asynchronous Progamming with Async and Await (C# and Visual Basic) </a>. The topic gives an overview of async programming, introduced with Visual Studio 2012, including when to use it and how you write an async method. This sample contains the async method
 that is used as an illustration.</p>
<p>Async programming provides all the advantages of traditional asynchronous programming, but with much less effort from the developer.&nbsp; Instead, the compiler does the difficult work that the developer used to do, and your program retains a logical structure
 that resembles synchronous code.</p>
<p>The example method in this sample uses an HttpClient method, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh551746">
GetStringAsync</a>, to download the contents of a website.</p>
<p>The code for the MainWindow.xaml.vb or MainWindow.xaml.cs file from this sample is included in the topic.</p>

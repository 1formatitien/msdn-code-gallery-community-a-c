						<h3>Reviews</h3>
						<br>
						<B>Publishers Weekly<BR>
						</B>Nothing is new in Munro's latest collection, which is to say that the 
						author continues to perfect her virtuosic formula in these eight short stories, 
						several of which previously appeared in the New Yorker.
						<BR>
						<BR>
						<BR>
						<B>Elaine Bender, Library Journal </B>
						<BR>
						Munro's new story collection will delight fans and convert those who have never 
						before read her work. Her spare style belies the psychological depth of the 
						stories, which feature characters running away from someone or something (often 
						representative of the past) or telling a lie by commission or omission (another 
						form of running away). Recommended for all libraries.
						<BR>
						<BR>
						<BR>
						<B>Kirkus Reviews<BR>
						</B>Retrospect and resolution, neither fully comprehended nor ultimately 
						satisfying: such are the territories the masterful Munro explores in her tenth 
						collection.....In a word: magnificent.
						<BR>
						<BR>
						<BR>
						<B>Francine Prose, More</B><BR>
						Dazzling...What’s astonishing about Munro’s work is how simultaneously 
						unsparing and forgiving it is, how willing she is to say things no one else 
						will admit out loud. Munro hasn’t mellowed with maturity. She only grows 
						sharper with time.<BR>
						<BR>
						<B>Elle Magazine Reader’s Prize</B><BR>
						A sensitive and deeply insightful writer, Munro renders hauntingly realistic 
						characters with an unflinching eye."<BR>

						<h3>Reviews</h3>
						<br>
						<B>The New York Times - Janet Maslin</B><BR>
						<I>The Lighthouse </I>is too rooted in genre conventions to count originality 
						as its strong suit. But it has deviousness to burn, and it also offers other 
						enticements. It's the kind of book that boasts a wryly humorous Scrabble scene, 
						not to mention a Scrabble-lover's vocabulary: Ms. James makes ready use of 
						words like abseil, belay, symphysis and meiosis. It's a book that serves up 
						figurative red herring as well as melon balls in orange sauce. Not a menu goes 
						unmentioned ... it is a sturdy installment in a well-honed series, which is a 
						concept that even its characters understand.<BR>
						<BR>
						<B>Kirkus Reviews</B><BR>
						Although the story is briefer than James's recent double-deckers, readers will 
						still revel in her matchless fullness of characterization. A stay on Combe 
						Island really is tonic.<BR>
						<BR>
						<B>The Toronto Sun</B><BR>
						With her trademark blend of subtle characterization, vivid sense of place and 
						deceptively simple plot, James pulls off another triumph. A beautifully written 
						page-turner from the queen of the genre.<BR>
						<BR>
						<B>The Globe &amp; Mail</B><BR>
						An elegant and perceptive writer - rich drifts of prose pile up on the page, 
						descriptive passages are Dickensian in length, ornament and power.... James's 
						many fans will relish <I>The Lighthouse</I>, for all its poise and narrative 
						familiarity.<BR>
						<BR>
						<B>Times Literary Supplement</B><BR>
						James's gifts animate and transform the armature into something exceptional. 
						Her disciplined conventions, her observation of social and class niceties, 
						renew the traditional Franco-British drama of domestic crime. She is a very 
						superior writer of detection.<BR>

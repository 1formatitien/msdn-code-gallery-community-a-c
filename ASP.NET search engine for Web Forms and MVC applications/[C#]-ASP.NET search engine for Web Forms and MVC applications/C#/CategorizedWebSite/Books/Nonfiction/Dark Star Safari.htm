						<h3>Reviews</h3>
						<br>
						<B>Booklist - Keir Graff<BR>
						</B>...his book contains page after page of eye-opening and insightful 
						observations. And for those of us who might squander our two weeks off on a 
						predictable cruise, Theroux's vantage point from the dusty road is very useful 
						indeed.<BR>
						<BR>
						<B>The New York Times - Rand Richards Cooper</B><BR>
						As Emerson went on to say, a writer engages despair by writing about it; ''in 
						calamity, he finds new materials.'' With <I>Dark Star Safari,</I> Theroux 
						reports his first trip into the last leg of life's voyage, and sends back a 
						brooding and apocalyptic report.<BR>
						<BR>
						<B>The Washington Post - Robert D. Kaplan</B><BR>
						Theroux is best at shorthand dissections of trends that have already become 
						obvious. In no other book will one find such entertaining and penetrating 
						comments about the ironies, as well as the historic failure, of foreign aid.
						<BR>
						<BR>
						<B>Kirkus Reviews (starred review)</B><BR>
						Engagingly written, sharply observed: another winner from Theroux.<BR>
						<BR>
						<B>Library Journal (starred review)<BR>
						</B>No mere tale of travel mishaps....Safari is Swahili for journey, and 
						Theroux's is truly fantastic.
						<BR>
						<BR>
						<BR>
						<B>The San Francisco Chronicle<BR>
						</B>Theroux, one suspects, could be a headache to travel with; resourceful, 
						courageous and indefatigable, as well as crusty, opinionated and contradictory. 
						But listening to him recount his adventures... is another matter. He can make 
						you forget to eat, this man.<BR>
						<BR>
						<BR>
						<B>Minneapolis Star-Tribune<BR>
						</B>Armchair travelers will wish the book went on twice as long -- and that is 
						something, considering that the book runs more than 400 pages. This is a 
						masterwork by a master writer.<BR>

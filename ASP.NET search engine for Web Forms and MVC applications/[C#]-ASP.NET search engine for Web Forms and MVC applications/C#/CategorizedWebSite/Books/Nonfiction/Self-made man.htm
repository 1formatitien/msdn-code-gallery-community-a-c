						<h3>Reviews</h3>
						<P>
							<br>
							<B>Publishers Weekly</B><BR>
							.... the most fascinating part of the story lies within Vincent herself-and the 
							way that censoring her emotions to pass as a man provoked a psychological 
							breakdown. For fans of <I>Nickel and Dimed</I>-style immersion reporting, this 
							book is a sure bet.<BR>
							<BR>
							<B>Nuala O'Faolain, author of <I>Are You Somebody?</I></B><BR>
							This gripping book got me through a delayed transatlantic flight beside a 
							shrieking baby. Could I say more? It was high-risk stuff, Norah Vincent's 
							undercover research into what men are like when they're in the places where men 
							are men. The reader's heart beats fast at the chances she took. In adventure 
							writing like this it is the quality of the adventurer that matters. Norah 
							Vincent's perceptiveness, and above all her large sympathies, make her the 
							perfect guide.<BR>
							<BR>
							<B>Christina Hoff Sommers</B><BR>
							A fascinating, original and often hilarious long day's journey into the world 
							of men. Posing as a man and infiltrating the female-free places males 
							congregate, Norah Vincent finds the male precincts to be a lot better--and a 
							lot worse--than most women ever imagine.<BR>
							<BR>
							<B>Library Journal - Jack Forman</B><BR>
							An often humorous, incisive, and fascinating account that validates the 
							conclusions of <I>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus</I>.<BR>
							<BR>
							<B>The New York Times Book Review</B><BR>
							...[A] thoughtful, diligent, entertaining piece of first-person journalism.... 
							[I]n its best moments,<I> Self-Made Man</I> transcends its premise altogether, 
							offering not an undercover woman's take on male experience, but simply a 
							fly-on-the-wall look at various unglamorous male milieus that are well off the 
							radar screen of most journalists and book authors. Rich and audacious.<BR>
							<BR>
							<B>Bruce Bawer, author of <I>A Place At the Table</I></B><BR>
							An extraordinary human document, rich in empathy and insight. Readers expecting 
							a light read about a diverting stunt will find themselves taking a riveting and 
							richly illuminating journey into some of their own deepest truths. You start 
							out peeping into a window and end up staring into a mirror.

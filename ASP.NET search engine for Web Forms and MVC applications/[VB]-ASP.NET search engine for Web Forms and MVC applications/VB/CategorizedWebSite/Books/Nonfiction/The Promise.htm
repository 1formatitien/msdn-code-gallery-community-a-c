							Brown is plainspoken, giving her views on everything from sternness to 
							listening, the impact of special people in your life, to practical matters of 
							setting up trust accounts and saving for your own child's higher education, 
							even when your income is scant.<BR>
							<BR>
							<B>Booklist - Vanessa Bush</B><BR>
							An inspirational look at the determination of one woman to make a difference in 
							her community and in the lives of disadvantaged children.<BR>

							<B>Tavis Smiley, author and host, Tavis Smiley on PBS</B><BR>
							With a selfless devotion that will inspire every reader, Mrs. Oral Lee Brown's 
							story has the power to change the way we feel about doing the work that needs 
							to be done. After reading this book, you will be empowered to take on 
							challenges in your own life and community. Oral Lee Brown is the kind of hero 
							we need more of!<BR>

							Oral Lee Brown is a remarkable role model. By adopting an entire elementary 
							class, she continues to share her success and perseverance with our entire 
							community. Surely, Oral Lee's efforts impact the students and their families, 
							but her selflessness is an example for everyone. Most importantly, she helped 
							cultivate Oakland's next community of leaders.<BR>

							<B>Erin Gruwell, author of <I>The Freedom Writers Diary</I></B><BR>
							What an amazing story, and what an amazing woman! Ms. Brown and her "kids" 
							stand as a beacon of hope to students everywhere who lack the access, but not 
							the drive to achieve higher education. This book will inspire you to reach 
							inside of yourself and discover how you can become an advocate in your own 
							community.

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In this code sample we are going to create a simple store locator using Bing Maps. Store locators are extremely common and a must for most businesses that sell directly to consumers. If you have only a couple of stores you may be able to get away with only
 showing an image of a map which shows the location of these store. However, if you have a chain of 5 or more stores, you really should have a store locator that has an interactive map as this will make it much easier for users to determine which store is most
 convenient for them to visit.</p>
<p>Store locators can be as simple or as complicated as you want it to be. In this code sample we will focus on creating a simple store locator. To keep things simple all the data for the locator is stored in the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff701734.aspx">Bing Spatial Data Services</a> and the application is self is written using HTML and JavaScript.</p>
<p>This code sample is for a blog post which you can find here [coming soon].</p>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>To get the application to run you will need a Bing Maps Keys. If you do not have one you can find infromation on how to create on
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/maps/create-a-bing-maps-key.aspx">here</a>. Once you have a BIng Maps key, open the Locator.js file and put your key where it says YOUR_BING_MAPS_KEY. Once this is done the application will be able to load Bing Maps and make
 queries against a data source of coffee shops that are in&nbsp;Seattle, San Antonia, San Diego and San Francisco</p>
<p>The following is a screenshot of the finished store locator.</p>

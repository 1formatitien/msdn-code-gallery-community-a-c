<p>This Contoso University application is used by the tutorial series at <a href="">
http://www.asp.net/web-forms/tutorials/deployment/visual-studio-web-deploy</a>. The abstract for the tutorial series is reproduced below:</p>
<h1>Tutorial Series Abstract</h1>
<p>This tutorial series shows you how to deploy (publish) an ASP.NET web application to a Windows Azure Web Site or a third-party hosting provider, by using Visual Studio 2012 with the Windows Azure SDK. Most of the procedures are similar for Visual Studio
 2010 and Visual Studio 2013.</p>
<p>You develop a web application in order to make it available to people over the Internet. But web programming tutorials typically stop right after they've shown you how to get something working on your development computer. This series of tutorials begins
 where the others leave off: you've built a web site, tested it, and it's ready to go. What's next? These tutorials show you how to deploy first to IIS on your local development computer for testing, and then to Windows Azure or a third-party hosting provider
 for staging and production. The sample application that you'll deploy is a web application project that uses the Entity Framework, SQL Server, and the ASP.NET membership system. The sample application uses ASP.NET Web Forms, but the procedures shown apply
 also to ASP.NET MVC and Web API.</p>
<p>These tutorials assume you know how to work with ASP.NET in Visual Studio. If you don&rsquo;t, a good place to start is a

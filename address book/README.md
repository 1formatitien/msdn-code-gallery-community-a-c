## Description

<p>This is an Address Book that uses Access as a back-end.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>The ADO.Net methods that i used in this example are practically<br>
identical to their SQL counterparts, so it doesn&rsquo;t take a lot of converting to<br>
switch between OleDb &#43; SQLClient or MySql.</p>

<p>I spent some time getting the names comboboxes working how i<br>
wanted them... i.e. DISTINCT &nbsp;names &#43;<br>
filtering so only applicable names are listed (depending on user selection in<br>
the other combobox).</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>All of the database functions (connecting, disconnecting,<br>
adding, updating, deleting, &#43; several miscellaneous functions &#43; methods) are<br>
contained in the dataLayer class.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Changing any of the edit controls, triggers a check to see<br>
if the current address has any changes, which results in the command buttons<br>
being enabled / disabled.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>If you forget to save your changes &#43; click the new button,<br>
you&rsquo;ll be prompted to save your changes. Similarly, if you forget to save any<br>
changes when you exit the application, you&rsquo;ll be prompted to save your changes.</p>

<p>The code in this example is commented throughout, but any<br>
questions, don&rsquo;t hesitate to ask, as that is what the Question&nbsp; &#43; Answer link on this page is for...</p>

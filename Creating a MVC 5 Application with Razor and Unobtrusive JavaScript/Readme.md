<p>I am using Visual Studio 2013 and hate the losing of references when I compiles an older project. I need to manually add back newer version of the references and&nbsp;change the web.config. I don't want to lose previous work even when I need to refer to
 it again. So, I upgraded it and put it back.</p>

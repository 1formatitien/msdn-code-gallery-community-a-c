<hr>
<p>&nbsp;The Open Data Protocol (OData) is a data access protocol for the web. OData provides a uniform way to query and manipulate data sets through CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete). Using ASP.NET Web API, it is easy to create an OData endpoint.
 You can control which OData operations are exposed. You can host multiple OData endpoints, alongside non-OData endpoints. You have full control over your data model, back-end business logic, and data layer.</p>

<p>The Open Data Protocol (OData) is a data access protocol for the web. OData provides a uniform way to structure data, query the data, and manipulate the data set through CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete).</p>
<p>OData supports both AtomPub (XML) and JSON formats. OData also defines a way to expose metadata about the data. Clients can use the metadata to discover the type information and relationships for the data set.</p>

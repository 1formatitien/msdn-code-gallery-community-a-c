<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><span style="font-size:small">The intent here is to demonstrate two things, filtering and finding data using the BindingSource. &nbsp;When working with data in Windows form projects were there are classes generated by a data wizard in the Visual Studio IDE
 a BindingSource component (class) is utilized for traversing data via a Binding Navigator control. For novice developers learning to use these classes past simple operations can be frustrating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:small">I created a VS2010 solution but excluded the SQL-Server demo, only does MS-Access. The VS2010 solution is on

<p><span style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold">Description</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small">A BindingSource can also be used when manually accessing data using one of the native data providers i.e. SqlClient, OleDb or a third party data provider such as IBM-DB2. The Visual Studio 2012 solution is broken down as follows,
 one class project for reading data from a MS-Access MDB database, another class project for language extension methods for working with filtering and finding data specifically with a BindingSource instance. There are two Windows Forms projects which uses the
 two class projects. One of the projects uses a MS-SQL Server local database to demonstrate using the BindingSource extensions to locate data. The other Windows Form project works against the MS-Access database. Both work at the DataTable level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small">In WindowsApplication1 (a windows form project) there are four child forms. DateForm demonstrates how to locate a specific record/row by a specific date. IncSearchForm demonstrates how to find the first row that starts with
 specific characters using an extension. There is a ComboBox which allows for the demonstration you to select which field to find data with. Caveat, even though I have in short hard coded the search to the start of a field in the form MultiColumnSearch there
 is a demonstration that shows how to use the like operator and have an enumeration to do a starts with, contains or ends with search. This logic can be used in the search in incSearchForm to extend past starts with search.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small">In the MultiColumnSearch form there is code which demonstrates using a like operator to do starts with, contains and end with searchs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small">One of my pet peeves is when a developer creates an application, displays data in a DataGridView but does not consider keeping the current row current after a sort operation has completed. In all of the child forms you will
 find simple code to keep the current row prior to a sort current after a sort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small">Lastly, the best way to learn with this solution is to first review the code, build/run the main project. Now go back and dig deeper into the code and see what is under the covers. The core code is in BindingSourceExtensions.vb
 in the project LanguageExtensionsLibrary.</span></p>
